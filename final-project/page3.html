    <h2>Main Content</h2>
    <p>The lines that delineate the width of the court are called the baseline (farthest back) and the service line (middle of the court). The short mark in the center of each baseline is referred to as either the hash mark or the center mark. The outermost lines that make up the length are called the doubles sidelines which is only used during doubles. The lines to the inside of the doubles sidelines are the singles sidelines and are used as boundaries in singles play. The area between a doubles sideline and the nearest singles sideline is called the doubles alley, which is considered playable in doubles play. The line that runs across the center of a player's side of the court is called the service line because the serve must be delivered into the area between the service line and the net on the receiving side. To start a point, the server must toss the ball and hit before it touches the ground and make it in over the net into the opposite side service box. If the server hits it outside the box or into the net, the server has a second chance to make it in but if he/she misses again it the opponents point. If the ball hits the net and goes in after serving it is called a “let” and the server may re-serve the ball.</p>
