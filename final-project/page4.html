    <p>After the serve goes in the player gets one bounce or no bounce to hit the ball over the net again and again until one person hits it out or into the net. The scoring goes with winning one point it is called 15, than 30, than 40, than game. If the opponent wins the same amount like 1 point each you would say 15 all and going on to 30 all. If both players win 3 points in one game it is called deuce. From their one player has to win 2 points in a row in order to win the game which score calling goes from deuce to Add-in if the server won the point or Add-out if the opponent wins. After game the person who won gets one game. After the receiver becomes the server and the server becomes the receiver. Players switch sides when there is an odd number of games. The players keep going until one gets 6 games first. If it is 5 to 5 in games the players play up to 7 games but if it is 6-6 they play a seven point tiebreak where players alternate serving games every odd number of points. If it is 6 all in the tiebreak, one player must win 2 points in a row to win the set. The match is played with 2 out of 3 sets where one player must win 2 sets to win the match.</p>
