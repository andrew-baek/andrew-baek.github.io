    <h2>Main Content</h2>
    <p>The term tennis has been mentioned way back in the middle ages in Old French and can be translated to “hold, receive, or take”. “Real Tennis” started in France where people hit a ball with their hands, than with gloves, and finally racquets. Lawn Tennis was finally introduced Between 1859 and 1865, in Birmingham, England, where Major Harry Gem, a solicitor, and his friend Augurio Perera, a Spanish merchant, combined elements of the game of rackets and the Spanish ball game pelota and played it on a croquet lawn in Edgbaston. Soon the modern game of tennis was driving around the world with the most prestigious tournaments the Australian Open, the French Open, Wimbledon, and the US Open.</p>
